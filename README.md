# Credentials-Manager
Credentials Manager App using MERN Stack

## Project

For this task I had to build an internal web app for managing credential "credential Management". Credentials are login details
(username & password) and can be for a variety of places — WP sites, servers,
financial accounts, etc. Because of the value of the credentials to be stored in the
app, it is of utmost importance that the app is authenticated airtight.
The web app has user login and registration, different user roles, and
different resource access for each user. Cool Tech has the following five

Organizational Units (OU):
● News management
● Software reviews
● Hardware reviews
● Opinion publishing

Each of these OUs has over 10 different divisions within them. Divisions take care of
subtasks like finances, IT, writing, development, and so on. Each division has its
own credential repository which contains a list of login details for various places. All
employees of the division should have access to it.
Most employees are only part of one OU and one division with it, but there are
some that are part of more than one OU and division. Furthermore, there should
be different user roles for the employees.

● Normal users can read the credential repository, and add new credentials in.
● Management users can do the above plus update credentials.
● Admin users can do the above plus they can assign and unassign users from divisions and OUs. They can also change the user role of any user.

## Installation

Clone the repository and extract the folder.

In the command line navigate in to "Credentials Manager Level 35" folder, type
`npm install`, and press enter.

The same must be done for in "backend" and "frontend" folders.

Then Navigate back to "Credentials Manager" folder in the command line and type `npm start`and press "enter".
